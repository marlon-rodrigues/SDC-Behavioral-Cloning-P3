Overview
---

In this project, I used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

I used a simulator provided by Udacity where you could steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
